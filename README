1. INTRO

This is SemanticSignup version 0.1.0

This is a MediaWiki extension built on top of Semantic MediaWiki
and SemanticForms extensions and intended to be used with them.

It is recommended to read these extensions' manuals before this one.

2. USAGE

This extension tweaks user registration process in order to make 
users populate their user pages with semantic data at registration time.
Whenever the user registration form is requested the user is redirected
to the Semantic Signup special page where he has to enter the usual
account data and some additional information into a semantic form.
When the form is submitted, the usual account information is used 
to register the new user account and a new User:<Username> page is 
populated with the additional data.

3. INSTALLATION

1. Create a semantic form for user pages (see the SemanticForms manual
for details). Use the <signupfields /> tag to insert the user account 
input fields (e. g. username password and all that stuff) into this form -
this is required for the form to be suitable for account registration.

2. Insert the following lines into your LocalSettings.php:

require_once('extensions/SemanticSignup/includes/SES_Main.php');
$sesSignupFormName = 'MyFormName';
$sesSignupBotName ='SignupBotName';

where "MyFormName" should be replaced with whatever the form 
created at step 1 is called (the namespace title - i.e. "Form:" - should not be included)
and "SignupBotName" is a name of a bot user account that will be used by SemanticSignup (you might need to create one).

4. CONFIGURATION

$sesSignupFormName controls the form which is displayed by the Semantic Signup
special page.

$sesRealNameRequired controls whether real name is required to register an account.

$sesSignupBotName controls the name of a bot account used by SemanticSignup. 
Currently the extension makes use of it when getting the signup form only 
in order to avoid it being disabled if an anonymous user hasn't got "edit" permissions.
